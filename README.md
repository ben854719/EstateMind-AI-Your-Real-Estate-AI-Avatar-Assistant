## EstateMind AI: Your Real Estate AI Avatar Assistant

## Objective:

The application will feature an agentic AI avatar that greets users and assists them seamlessly in both English and French, providing clear guidance about our real estate products. To ensure strong data protection, the platform will use RS256 encryption, securing all user interactions and stored information. The system will also include a built‑in customer satisfaction survey and a performance dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as a User Satisfaction Score (USS) target of 90%, a Net Promoter Score (NPS) goal of +45, an Avatar Engagement Rate aiming for 75% of active users, and an Average Response Time under 1.2 seconds. Additional KPIs such as Feature Adoption Rate (target: 60% within the first 30 days), Survey Completion Rate (target: 40%), and Issue Resolution Accuracy (target: 95%) will help the company monitor product performance, identify improvement opportunities, and continuously enhance the user experience.

## Features:

## Bilingual AI avatar assistant:

- Greets and guides users in English and French, explains real estate products, and walks them through key flows (search, booking, questions).

## - Embedded satisfaction survey:

## Short, in-context survey (e.g., after a session or resolved issue) capturing:

- User Satisfaction Score (USS) (e.g., 1–5 or 1–10 scale).
  
- NPS question (“How likely are you to recommend…?” 0–10).
  
- Issue resolution feedback (resolved? accuracy rating).
  
- Feature usage (which features were used in the session.)

## Performance & experience dashboard:

## Matplotlib-based dashboard showing:

- USS vs target 90%.
  
- NPS vs target +45.

- Average Response Time vs target 1.2 seconds.
  
- Feature Adoption Rate (used feature within 30 days, target 60%).
  
- Survey Completion Rate (completed ÷ prompted, target 40%).
  
- Issue Resolution Accuracy (correctly resolved ÷ total issues, target 95%).
