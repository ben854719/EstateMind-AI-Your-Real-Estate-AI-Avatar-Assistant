## EstateMind AI: Your Real Estate AI Avatar Assistant

## Objective:

The application will feature an agentic AI avatar that greets users and assists them seamlessly in both English and French, providing clear guidance about our real estate products. To ensure strong data protection, the platform will use RS256 encryption, securing all user interactions and stored information. The system will also include a built‑in customer satisfaction survey and a performance dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as a User Satisfaction Score (USS) target of 90%, a Net Promoter Score (NPS) goal of +45, an Avatar Engagement Rate aiming for 75% of active users, and an Average Response Time under 1.2 seconds. Additional KPIs such as Feature Adoption Rate (target: 60% within the first 30 days), Survey Completion Rate (target: 40%), and Issue Resolution Accuracy (target: 95%) will help the company monitor product performance, identify improvement opportunities, and continuously enhance the user experience.
